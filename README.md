# TSA-througput-data
Data for airport and checkpoint level passenger flows as provided by the TSA (https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom)

Currently updated with releases through 14 JULY 2020.

Data for week of June 7 - June 13, 2020 will have missing datapoints due to poor formatting in the PDF release. Addition of those data is still pending as it requires quite a bit of manual cleaning.

Data parsed by Tabula. Cleaning scripts in python and R written by Kevin Sullivan

Data maintained by quarter to keep file sizes down.

Useful complementary dataset is ourairports.com to get specific airport data https://ourairports.com/data/
